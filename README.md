### Projects vs Apps [(Cite)](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/#creating-the-polls-app)

"An app is a Web application that does something â€“ e.g., a Weblog system, a database of public records or a small poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects"

### FAQ

**App is broken after changing `app/settings.py` (update database, etc)**

- Run `docker-compose build` to rebuild the containers with the updated value(s)

**App throwing errors on Models**

- Run `docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate` (Might be attempting to access tables that do not yet exist)
